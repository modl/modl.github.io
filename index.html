  <h3>Introducing MOD Labs</h3>
  <p class="lead">
    Earlier this year, <a href="http://markitondemand.com">Markit On Demand</a> launched MOD Labs (MOD/L), a team whose aim is to enhance existing capabilities, create new solutions, and foster innovation across our organization.  We recognize that innovation is as much the creation of original ideas as it is the recognition and dissemination of existing progressive concepts and methods within our broader organization.  MOD/L aims to inform the working methods of MOD teams and to recognize innovative work from those teams as it happens.
