        <h3>Welcome to MOD Labs</h3>
        <p class="lead">
          Earlier this year, <a href="http://markitondemand.com">Markit On Demand</a> launched MOD Labs (MOD/L), a team whose aim is to enhance existing capabilities, create new solutions, and foster innovation across the organization.  We recognize that innovation is as much the creation of original ideas as it is the recognition and dissemination of existing progressive concepts and methods within our broader organization.  MOD/L aims to inform the working methods of MOD teams and to recognize innovative work from those teams as it happens.

          <h2>Next-gen Interactive Charting</h2>
          <div class="black-module">
            <img src="images/interactive.png" class="img-responsive" />
            <p>MOD/L is creating a new way of charting financial data; next gen charting will be faster and more engaging, will work across all platforms and will provide streaming charts.</p>
      </div>
          <h2>Technical Analysis Pattern Recognition</h2>
          <div class="black-module">
            <img src="images/tech_analysis.png" class="img-responsive" />
            <p>MOD/L is creating a machine learning engine that can be fed particular technical analysis patterns, and identify new patterns as they arise on a particular security.  This capability will enhance MODâ€™s existing charting, screener, and overall presentation of actionable investment ideas.</p>
      </div>
          <h2>Content Personalization</h2>
          <div class="black-module">
            <img src="images/interactive.png" class="img-responsive" />
        <p>MOD/L is working on a capability that will personalize the content and layout presented to a user, based on various attributes of the user's behavior, trading history, and research interests.  For example, presenting a user only with the fundamentals and events relevant to their portfolio; creating a trail of their research and news interests, and emphasizing certain datasets or news providers; or presenting a layout and experience thatâ€™s more relevant to a retirement investor than a day trader.</p>

MOD/L continues receive feedback from the F2 community, and those recommendations are shaping the F2 roadmap.</p>

<h2>Jetpack</h2>
<div class="black-module col-12" id="jetpack">
         
          <p>Jetpack is a framework to help any MOD employee take an idea from napkin sketch to full production implementation in as short a time as possible.  The framework is intended to provide visibility, support and feedback, encourage lateral skills development, and ultimately, launch the best ideas MOD has to offer.  Correspondingly, it outlines a means to stop an idea when it is not viable or is failing for any number of reasons, and it is the intent of this framework to make it safe for ideas and projects in this environment to fail.</p>
