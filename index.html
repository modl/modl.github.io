  <h3>Introducing MOD Labs</h3>
  <p class="lead">
    Earlier this year, <a href="http://www.markit.com/Product/Markit-On-Demand" target="_blank">Markit On Demand</a> launched MOD Labs (MOD/L), a team whose aim is to enhance existing capabilities, create new solutions, and foster innovation across our organization. We recognize that innovation is as much the creation of original ideas as it is the recognition and dissemination of existing progressive concepts and methods within our broader organization. MOD/L aims to inform the working methods of MOD teams and to recognize innovative work from those teams as it happens.

        <img src="{{site.url}}/images/content_personalization.png" class="img-responsive" title="Content Personalization" />
        <p>MOD/L is working on a capability that will personalize the content and layout presented to a user, based on various attributes of the user&rsquo;s behavior, trading history, and research interests. For example, presenting a user only with the fundamentals and events relevant to their portfolio; creating a trail of their research and news interests, and emphasizing certain datasets or news providers; or presenting a layout and experience that&rsquo;s more relevant to a retirement investor than a day trader.</p>

    <div class="black-module">
      <img src="{{site.url}}/images/tech_analysis.png" class="img-responsive" />
      <p>MOD/L is creating a machine learning engine that can be fed particular technical analysis patterns, and identify new patterns as they arise on a particular security.  This capability will enhance MOD&rsquo;s existing charting, screener, and overall presentation of actionable investment ideas.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-pull-3">
          <p>In 2011, MOD started doing something we call <a href="/dwywd/2012/12/12/do-what-you-want-day/">Do What You Want Day</a> (DWYWD), inspired by other organizations&rsquo; hackathons, <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/company/about/shipit" target="_blank">ShipIt Days</a> and even Google&rsquo;s own 20% time. The basic idea: work on whatever you want for a day. We&rsquo;ve now run 5 of these events in our Boulder offices, and several others in our Dallas, New York, and Noida offices, to great success.</p>
          <div class="visible-xs visible-sm visible-md pull-right jetpack-img"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/jetpack_logo_250.png" class="" /></div>
          <p>Jetpack is a program to help any MOD employee take an idea from napkin sketch to full production implementation for a client in as short a time as possible.  It arose out of our employees asking what to do with the really good DWYWD projects after they&rsquo;re over, as well as our team&rsquo;s passion to take great ideas, and make them real.</p>
          <p>The Jetpack process itself is quite simple:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Make It Work (<span class="char-code">&alpha;</span>lpha)</li>
            <li>Make Sure It&rsquo;s A Good Idea(<span class="char-code">&beta;</span>eta)</li>
            <li><strong>!</strong> Live</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The framework is intended to provide visibility, support and feedback, encourage lateral skills development, and ultimately, launch the best ideas MOD has to offer. Correspondingly, it outlines a means to stop an idea when it is not viable or is failing for any number of reasons, and it is the intent of this framework to make it safe for ideas and projects in this environment to fail; it is also the intent to help ensure success for projects that are going well.</p>
