We are afraid of everything. We are afraid of pointing our lives in the wrong direction. We are afraid of making mistakes. Setting faulty precedents. Getting it wrong.

To mitigate these fears, we rely on information. We collect this information with our senses, parse it with our brain, use it to make decisions, and store it away in the annals of memory. Information keeps our fears in check by using data collected about the past to our advantage in the future. It makes us feel well-equipped for what is to come.

Now imagine sitting in front of the soft glow of a spreadsheet containing 50,000 data points. Information suddenly seems overwhelming&ndash;even fear-enducing. But why? If information is useful for decision making, why is a large quantity of information so daunting?


###The Crystal Goblet

Before we answer that question, a quick aside.

In 1955, a young designer named Beatrice Warde wrote The Crystal Goblet in Typography, an essay which brilliantly compared the process of designing the pages of a book to that of designing a wine glass.

She noted that if a wine glass is well-designed, every characteristic of the glass will support and amplify the experience around which it was designed. The stem allows the wine to be carried without obscuring the shades of ruby and plum seen through the crystal. The base allows the wine to be swirled, its aromas and flavors released and carried toward the bulbous rim where they are observed and enjoyed by the drinker. The design of the glass itself may be a beautiful object, but its embrace of the overall experience is where it becomes magic.

When crafting a book, Warde proselytized that the designer's job is similar: make every moment of the book respect and amplify the experience of reading the text itself. The designer carefully removes distractions, formalizes hierarchy, adds emphasis, and controls pace. In the end, the designer recedes, leaving the reader to simply experience the text to its fullest. 

Now, let's get back to that overwhelming spreadsheet. Complex multifaceted spreadsheets can seem daunting to anyone&ndash;designers included&ndash;but we should also see them as an opportunity. Great stories hide within. Just like the creation of a well-crafted wine glass or book, the designer can clarify content and amplify experiences for a reader, abating the fear of information overload.


###Think, Analyze & Concept

Recently we conducted a series of sessions where we tried to overcome our own fears about data. We started with a complex spreadsheet of 1000 publicly-traded companies, with roughly fifty data points about each. Spread across three one-hour blocks of time in a recurring session we call T&ndash;A&ndash;C, designers broke into groups to sift through the data in stages:

===

###Week 1: Think
Looking at the data for the first time, the teams focused on exploring hunches. What stories might be hidden in the data? How could two data points be compared? What is confusing about the data that could be clarified? What if we look at a single company versus all companies? The teams wrote down as many hunches as possible without questioning or verifying them.

###Week 2: Analyze
After creating a list of hunches, it came time to see if they held any weight. The teams used a simple scatterplot tool built by one of our designers to quickly plot one column of data against another, helping quickly verify hunches with real data, often revealing new stories in the data overlooked during the first session.

###Week 3: Concept
In the final week, teams formalized their validated hunches by sketching some concepts on a whiteboard for how the information could be displayed. Like in the first week, the teams explored as many ideas as possible. Teams tried sketching a map, moved to a line chart, then moved to a simple snapshot, and back again.

===

The three-week process got us far very quickly, from hunches to validated ideas. For example, one team remembered that Apple was criticized for hoarding cash rather than paying dividends back to investors, which became a hunch: What types of companies with lots of cash-on-hand offer little dividend yield? By plotting the actual data in the second week, they discovered that most companies who fit this profile are actually banks, which started to lead them down some new paths and inspire new questions. In the third week, they were able to explore ideas of how to tell these stories visually, comparing individual companies to the normal amounts of cash-hoarding or dividend-paying within their industries.


###The Remarkable Power of Hunches

The intention of the exercise was to raise a designer's comfort level&ndash;and consequently reduce their fear&ndash;about exploring data. Valuable in this process is to create a list of hunches before the real designing even begins. Hunches carry less risk (and fear) than an idea. An idea implies a sense of possible correctness, while a mere hunch signals that further exploration will be needed prior to having a well-formed idea.

At its core, the exercise disconnects idea-generation from idea-validation, or in other words, the creating from the editing. Designers need to do both creating and editing eventually, but many more possibilities open up when we purposefully defer the editing process to later. It's a simple shift with huge ramifications: instead of having to be right, you leave yourself open to being right or wrong. That's less scary, to be sure.

In Warde's essay, the creator of the wine glass and the designer of the book did a lot of hard work in advance to ensure they improved an experience for the drinker or the reader. Designing information is no different: all of the hunches, false-starts, confusion, validation, mistakes, whiteboard sketches&ndash;all the hard work and fear overcome&ndash;ends up disappearing from the final product because it is absorbed during the design process. That has a lot of value because the designer takes the fear and uncertainty off of the shoulders of readers.

Sadly, the reverse is also true:  that if we are lazy or presumptuous, we require our audience to do a lot of work to understand what we mean. Beatrice Warde stressed this point in her wine analogy, describing a clunky opaque goblet, gilded and bejeweled to the designer's satisfaction. But it was a failed design because it obfuscated and worsened the experience of imbibing the wine itself. The designer tried to decorate the wine instead of embracing it.

When designing information, that urge to decorate rather than understand data comes from fear. We can tell great stories, provide thoughtful analysis, and create long lasting knowledge if we are willing to roll up our sleeves and do a little work. We have to be willing to confront our fears. 

Start with simple hunches. Embrace curiosity. Verify findings and transform them into even more questions. Keep adding fidelity and formality into the process until a solid solution takes shape. Above all, be fearless.
