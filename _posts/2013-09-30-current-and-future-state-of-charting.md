###Where Are We Now?

MOD set the bar in web-based financial charting over a decade ago. Using a combination of precision design, our handcrafted charting technology, Ajax, and carefully implemented javascript UI, we were able to eliminate the reliance on Java applets and Flash files for customized equity charts. We have refined the underlying technology to minimize our implementation time, even while making the charts even more customizable. We have also refined all of the tiny details that go into making a chart beautiful, down to the last axis tick and Nikkei lunch break. This charting platform has been primarily image-based, with accompanying meta data to drive interactivity.

Today, users expect even more from their charts -- both in their browser, as well as on their tables and phones. They expect a high level of interactivity, including &lsquo;pinch-to-zoom&rsquo;, drawing trendlines and Fibonacci retracements, and the ability to share a chart with other investors. They expect streaming on the chart, animated transitions, as well as every possible indicator known to Technical Analysis.

In the past, browser incompatibilities and performance issues made true browser-based charting very difficult. As browser makers have continued to implement web standards, and machine and tablet performance continues to follow Moore&rsquo;s Law, achieving investor's expectations on charting is very achievable.  Translation libraries such as Jquery and D3 allow for browser differences (especially around vector rendering, which remains inconsistent) to be abstracted away, freeing developers to focus on the charts, rather than the browsers.

###What Are We Doing About It?

MOD/L has assembled an elite team of charting experts to build upon our charting capabilities, and allow our charts to do all of the above, and more. Each member of this team has reviewed and worked with various charting packages, frameworks and technologies over the years, including [HighCharts](http://highcharts.com), [D3](http://d3js.org), [Shinobi](http://shinobi.com) and many others. We are using the best parts of our own technologies, partnering and learning from others in this space, and combining all of it again set the bar on interactive financial charting.

Go Imageless - use the metadata and intelligence, but not the raster image.

Some of this effort has already resulted in LiveCharts, a new capability for IOS charting, allowing for &lsquo;pinch-to-zoom&rsquo; and smooth, native interactions. Need more LiveCharts copy here, and an image.

The team is also currently in the &alpha;lpha stage of a Jetpack project to push the boundaries of browser-based
