If you're like me, you've probably heard about Bitcoin but don't really understand what on earth it actually is. [This podcast](http://www.muleradio.net/thetalkshow/74/) has a great explanation of Bitcoin by Glenn Fleishman, who writes about the digital currency for the Economist. The Bitcoin part starts at 26:25.
 
Also, they talk a lot about public and private keys and cryptography in this podcast. The [modern cryptography](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/applied-math/cryptography) section of Khan Academy has a great explanation of how these keys actually work.  Specifically [this video](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/applied-math/cryptography/modern-crypt/v/diffie-hellman-key-exchange--part-1)
