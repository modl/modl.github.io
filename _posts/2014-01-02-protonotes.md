ProtoNotes evolved from a concept several of our Senior Web Developers came up with during a break out session. We wanted to find a way to make managing requirements easier and in the forefront of the development cycle. ProtoNotes allows you to put thoughts, questions and requirements directly on top of a prototype image. We use it constantly to communicate across teams and ensure that each component of a page is understood.

Our latest addition to ProtoNotes is the ability to integrate our data maps. Our development teams no longer needs to open a separate spreadsheet to determine where data comes from, further optimizing our process.

In three years we have edited over 1,850 prototypes and created over 6,600 notes.
