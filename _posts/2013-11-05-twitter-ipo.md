#Internal Preparation
This is a big deal for a lot of our clients and an exciting event. IPOs like this don’t happen that often and the events that take place on Thursday will likely be discussed for months if not years from now (just look at Facebook, companies and investors are still dealing with fallout over that IPO and it was one of the main reasons Twitter went with NYSE instead of NASDAQ).
The best part is we have front row seats for all this!
 
Where they price their offering will be very interesting. Facebook dropped hard post IPO, perhaps they were overly optimistic... Will twitter rise out of the gate? Goldman (lead underwriter) will be vigorously defending the IPO price (often viewed as a failure if the price dips below the IPO price). Don’t know the ins and outs of IPOs? Do a bit of googling today and learn. I can’t pretend to be an IPO expert but getting a good sense of the process and where we are at the moment with twitter makes the events that are unfolding very interesting indeed.

You are probably all aware that Twitter is going public on Thursday, and major IPOs like this have traditionally driven our traffic to new highs. It would not be surprising to see a repeat of the load profile we saw when Facebook debuted in 2012. We performed very well that day, but there were a few instances where sharp eyes and quick adjustments helped avoid problems. We sell our services based on the strength of our hosting and our ability to perform flawlessly during days like these that challenge our clients and competitors, and we need to be prepared for another great showing this week.
