Last week, the <a href="http://www.markit.com/Product/Markit-On-Demand" target="_blank">Markit On Demand</a> teams planned for, executed, and documented the Twitter IPO.  For most of the world, this is an event most investors and journalists follow the news and pricing on.  At Markit On Demand, we deliver all of that news, pricing and charts, and do it as perfectly as we can.  We've always taken a 'don't show a broken image, and don't go down' mentality to IPO days, and Twitter was no different -- in fact, all of the experience and upfront work from our teams made this a non-event. This is how we do it.

##Internal Preparation

11:05am 11/4/2013

From our head of Client Solutions, Michael Repsher: 

This is a big deal for a lot of our clients and an exciting event. IPOs like this don't happen that often and the events that take place on Thursday will likely be discussed for months if not years from now (just look at Facebook, companies and investors are still dealing with fallout over that IPO and it was one of the main reasons Twitter went with NYSE instead of NASDAQ).
The best part is we have front row seats for all this!
 
Where they price their offering will be very interesting. Facebook dropped hard post IPO, perhaps they were overly optimistic... Will twitter rise out of the gate? Goldman (lead underwriter) will be vigorously defending the IPO price (often viewed as a failure if the price dips below the IPO price). Don't know the ins and outs of IPOs? Do a bit of googling today and learn. I can't pretend to be an IPO expert but getting a good sense of the process and where we are at the moment with twitter makes the events that are unfolding very interesting indeed.

And from our Head of Engineering:

You are probably all aware that Twitter is going public on Thursday, and major IPOs like this have traditionally driven our traffic to new highs. It would not be surprising to see a repeat of the load profile we saw when Facebook debuted in 2012. We performed very well that day, but there were a few instances where sharp eyes and quick adjustments helped avoid problems. We sell our services based on the strength of our hosting and our ability to perform flawlessly during days like these that challenge our clients and competitors, and we need to be prepared for another great showing this week.

This is how we're preparing:
* Make sure we recognize the symbol TWTR and have as much data as possible
* TWTR has already been manually entered into our symbol cross reference systems.
* News is already present on most sites.
* When market data starts flowing, it will be on our pages as well.
* Make sure there are no capacity issues
* Organize to ensure all hands are available to address unforeseen issues
* Staff will be proactively looking at metrics and investigating any signs of trouble.
* Systems teams will be prepared to supplement web pools or make other adjustments to address localized spikes.

Updates from Chris Muth, in our Financial Analysis team:

###Twitter Highlights

*   On Thursday, November 7th,  TWTR will begin trading shares on the NYSE ranging in price from $23 - $25 per share, an increase from previous range of $17 - $20.
*   Given the demand, hype and attention this IPO has received, the deal is currently oversubscribed indicating that there are more orders on the books than the roughly 70M shares they are offering. Higher demand = higher price. This has given the underwriting banks (Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley) the ability to raise the target price.
*   TWTR is expected to have a market cap around $13.6B (FB = $90.9B, LNKD = $22.8B, YELP = $3.8B).
*   TWTR is expected to raise approximately $1.6B in capital by going public.
*   Expect a fair amount of volatility in TWTR's price on 11/7.
*   Ultimately, the price target is a best guess based on analysts' estimates and forecasts leading up to the IPO. Ultimately come 4:00PM EST, the market will have decided what the true per share price is for TWTR.

12:34pm 11/6/2013

And up it goes...
Reports now are saying that twitter is likely to price its IPO above its already increased range. As Chris mentions below, they started in the range of $17 to $20 per share, then bumped it to the $23 to $25 range, now we are hearing even higher numbers. Final price should be coming out later today and then we get to see what the market says tomorrow.

So we have a price now: $26

CNBC also has a very interesting bar chart as well. It will be interesting to see what happens tomorrow.

##Execution - November 7

All teams were on call at Market Open, and play-by-plays were called throughout the morning: 

7:36am 11/7/2013
Why isn't Twitter trading? The market is open.
 
This is pretty normal for IPOs. Here's a quick summary:
But don't be alarmed if Twitter doesn't start trading immediately when the market opens. It's not unusual for hot initial public offerings to briefly sit out trading while the exchange gauges demand and sets an opening price.
> "It wouldn't surprise me if it took 45 minutes" after the opening bell, said David Ethridge, who heads the IPO business at NYSE Euronext. "It wouldn't surprise me if it took an hour."

7:57am 11/7/2013
We are getting closer to the first trade. Indications are it could open around $42. Big jump from $26


8:06am 11/7/13
And the hype keeps on going. Range is in the $45 to $46 range. Waiting on the 'book is frozen' call then twitter will open 10 seconds laterâ€¦
Very very close to opening


8:26am 11/7/2013
Price is still bouncing around, doesn't feel like it is as close to opening now. Range is $45 to $47, that needs to get down to a tighter range before they open.


8:50am 11/7/2013
It's trading!!!!!!!!!!!! 45.10





##Outcome
Donuts picture?

Our Head of Engineering updates on the otherwise uneventful morning:

The open looked to be 25-30% higher than the day before, but load dropped off and the close was indistinguishable from a normal day. The peak quote rate was roughly 2/3 of the peak we saw for Facebook's IPO. Surely a high volume day, and the open peak lasted longer than usual, but not as much of a peak as Facebook or the Flash Crash.

Reviews of all sites sent to all staff, charts of TWTR, recommendations for improvement from all teams
