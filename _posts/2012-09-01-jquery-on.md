# jQuery On

### What is a function signature?
The parameters/inputs a function accepts. Some common examples:

{% highlight javascript %}
	.addClass( className )  
	.ajax( url [,settings] )
{% endhighlight %}
### Let's look at the signature of On
	.on( events [, selector][, data], handler( eventObject )

### A simple click event using On
	#( 'a' ).on( 'click', function () {} );

This is identical to:  
	$( 'a' ).click(function () {} );  
	$( 'a' ).bind( 'click', function () {} );

### A more complex example
	$( 'a.edit, button.add' ).on( 'click', function () {} );

So what's wrong with this?

### Huge Performance Cost
	$( 'a' ).on( 'click', function () {} );  
	$( 'a.edit, button.add' ).on( 'click', function () {} );

It has to first find all these elements in the DOM. And filtering by class name and other CSS properties is expensive (takes a long time) in IE 7 and 8. And an event is attached to every element it finds (takes more memory). And not to mention that all of this occurs on **PAGE LOAD**

### Along comes Event Delegation
	$( '#module' ).on( 'click', 'button', function () {} );

A single event is attached to the container element.

By virtue of event bubbling, any clicks step up the DOM tree and are eventually caught by your container. The expected result is identical.

### Case in point - a real world example
Attached to every found element - 300ms

	$( '.btnRefresh', this.$researchListingCont[0].on( 'click', function () {  
		_this.update();  
	});`

Delegated from the container - 0m (yes, zero!)

	this.$researchListingCont.on( 'click', '.btnRefresh', function () {  
		_this.update();  
	});

### So what do I get besides a performance boost?
Event management becomes simplified. Attach them once and forget about it for the life of the page, even when content is added or replaced.

Set it and forget it.

### Doesn't live() already offer this?
It does, but:

1. live() binds to the HTML node.
2. Events need to bubble all the way up the tree, and the $.matchesSelector function has lots more processing to do.
3. You'll soon run into conflicts with using the same selectors. These are not fun to debug.

Oh yeah, live() is deprecated as of jQuery 1.7. They knew it was evil. To that effect, never delegate with &lt;body&gt;.

### What's passed to the callback function?
jQuery provides a normalized event.

* currentTarget - the element you care about
* type - click, change, mouseenter
* pageX and pageY - the mouse position relative to the entire document
* data - if you passed it as the 3rd argument to "on"

### What about "this"?
* Don't let jQuery control your context. "this" should always point to your class instance
* Don't use anonymous functions. Use $.proxy and break it into a prototype method. "self" is not your friend
* Access the element with event.currentTarget

	Module = function () {}  
	Module.prototype.init = function() {  
		$( '#module' ).on( 'click', 'button', $.proxy(this.buttonClicked, this));  
	}
	Module.prototype.buttonClicked = function (e) {  
		var #el = $(e.currentTarget);  
	}

### Best Practice
* Bind to the deepest node/container that you can. This reduces bubbling and creates separation of content concerns
* Keep your *target element selector* simple so $.matchesSelector has to do less work
	$( '#module' ).on( 'click', 'td' );
rather than
	$( '#module' ).on( 'click', 'table tbody tr td' );
* Call preventDefault and stopPropagation in your handler function
