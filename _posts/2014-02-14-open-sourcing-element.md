Like any good team of web developers, Markit On Demand has borrowed a lot from the open source community over the years. As much as we are innovators, we are also adapters. These days in the world of web development, it is easy to assume that The Industry has already found a graceful solution for whatever problem you may be trying to solve. Sometimes, however, your problem may be unique or it may be one that The Industry didn't realize it had.

We've stubbornly resisted using [Web Forms](http://www.asp.net/web-forms) and mostly forgone popular view engines like [Razor]( http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2010/07/02/introducing-razor.aspx) in favor of our homegrown solution&mdash;Element. After many years, and just as many iterations, I'm happy to announce that we're releasing Element into the wild. 

We are excited to see the graceful solutions the community will create using this library and look forward to contributions that will take Element to the next level. To learn more about Element, check out the [project page](http://markitondemand.github.io/MOD.Web.Element/) and find the source on [GitHub](https://github.com/markitondemand/MOD.Web.Element). 

Happy coding!
