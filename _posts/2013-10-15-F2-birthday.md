### Happy birthday, F2!

One year ago yesterday we launched F2 and introduced to the financial services community a brand-new way of integrating tools and content from multiple providers into a single, seamlessly integrated front-end. Since last October, the F2 community has grown to include some of the financial industry's biggest firms. Led by F2 Advisory Board members, these participating firms are demanding websites that are fast, versatile and built upon standards and open-source technology. Being efficient, iterating quickly, reducing time to market as well as complexity without compromising security are no longer dreams of product and technology owners; they are facts of life. The growing F2 team at Markit On Demand (MOD) continues to work hard to ensure the framework is easy for technology teams to adopt, simple for developers to follow, and modern for today's savvy and demanding users.
